# Week 5 SQL Solution
In this assignment all the queries should be from a single table and apply DQL statement.

## Question 1:
*Select the first 5 rows in the category table?*

This is a very simple query, you are asked to find all the data in the first 5 rows of data. A SELECT * from the table shall give all the rows of data. A LIMIT 5 would reduce the result set to only the first  rows
```sql
SELECT * from Category
limit 5
```
