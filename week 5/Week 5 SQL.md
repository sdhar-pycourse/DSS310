# Week 5 SQL Solution
In this assignment all the queries should be from a single table and apply DQL statement.

## Question 1:
*Select the first 5 rows in the category table?*

This is a very simple query, you are asked to find all the data in the first 5 rows of data. A SELECT * from the table shall give all the rows of data. A LIMIT 5 would reduce the result set to only the first  rows
```sql
SELECT * from Category
limit 5
```

## Question 2:
*How many customers are there in the customer table?*

Mark the changed semantics, *how many*- so this must be a count. Count of what? Customers. What is the identifier/ primary key of customer table? **Id**
Does CompanyName or any other field work? Well for the sake of this assignment I may give you the 1 point but in reality the primary key is the correct choice.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(Id) from Customer
```

## Question 3:
*How many customers are from the 'British Isles'?*

The only difference betwen Q2 is additional clause on *'British Isles'*. Where can we find the information on British Isles? The ideal way to find out the column name where there is a entry *'British Isles'*. If you look through the columns and write a query such the following,  for each of the columns. Pick the column where the count() = 1 

```sql
SELECT count(distinct Region) from Customer
WHERE Region= 'British Isles'
-- 8
```
‚ùî If you had 2 columns that had count()= 1, thenw hat nornal form do you think you would violate?

The query tells us that 'British Isles' is an entry in the Region column

Now for the final solution to get the count of customers:

```sql
SELECT count(id) from Customer
WHERE Region= 'British Isles'
```
